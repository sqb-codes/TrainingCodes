Introduction to Python Programming

	1. General Purpose
		a. Web development
		b. Software development
		c. Mobile app development
		d. AI/ML
		e. Testing
		f. Analysis
	2. Dynamically Typed
	3. Multi-paradigm
		a. Procedural
		b. Object Oriented
		c. Functional - Functions are first class citizens
	4. Interpreted
	5. High level language
	6. Easy to Use

Two Types of Programming
	1. Statically Typed
	2. Dynamically Typed

Statically Typed: fixed
	- Fixed type of allocation
	- C, C++, Java, C#
Example:
int x = 12;
x = "hello"; x
x = 75765757656576; // out of range of int
Byte - 1 byte =>
Int - 4 byte => 
Long - 8 Byte

How to calculate range ?
1 byte = 8 bit, n = 8
-2n-1 to 2n-1 - 1, why n-1 = because 1 bit is reserve for sign +,-
-27 to 27 - 1
-128 to 127

4 byte = 32 bit, n = 32
-2n-1 to 2n-1 - 1
-231 to 231 - 1
-2147483648 to 2147483647


Dynamically Typed: change
	- Memory allocated on runtime
	- Python, JavaScript, R

X = 32123
X = "hello"
X = 3904782309482309482


How to print anything in Python?
print()

Taking Input in Python
input("")
