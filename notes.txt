Introduction to Python Programming

	1. General Purpose
		a. Web development
		b. Software development
		c. Mobile app development
		d. AI/ML
		e. Testing
		f. Analysis
	2. Dynamically Typed
	3. Multi-paradigm
		a. Procedural
		b. Object Oriented
		c. Functional - Functions are first class citizens
	4. Interpreted
	5. High level language
	6. Easy to Use

Two Types of Programming
	1. Statically Typed
	2. Dynamically Typed

Statically Typed: fixed
	- Fixed type of allocation
	- C, C++, Java, C#
Example:
int x = 12;
x = "hello"; x
x = 75765757656576; // out of range of int
Byte - 1 byte =>
Int - 4 byte => 
Long - 8 Byte

How to calculate range ?
1 byte = 8 bit, n = 8
-2n-1 to 2n-1 - 1, why n-1 = because 1 bit is reserve for sign +,-
-27 to 27 - 1
-128 to 127

4 byte = 32 bit, n = 32
-2n-1 to 2n-1 - 1
-231 to 231 - 1
-2147483648 to 2147483647


Dynamically Typed: change
	- Memory allocated on runtime
	- Python, JavaScript, R

X = 32123
X = "hello"
X = 3904782309482309482


How to print anything in Python?
print()

Taking Input in Python
input("")


Data Types

Number
	- Int => x = 10
	- Float => x = 12.45
	- Complex => z = 3 + 5j
Boolean
	- Bool => flag = True/False
String
	- Str => name = "Python"
Bytes
	- Bytes => b = b"hello"
Data Collection
	- List => names = ["ram", "shyam", "john"]
	- Tuples => coords = (14,50,23)
	- Dictionary => data = {name:"Ram", age:20}
	- Set & Frozenset => {3,4,6,7}
NoneType
	- None => x = None


Operators
Arithmetic Operators - Mathematical Operations
+, -, *, /, %, //, **

Comparison/Relational Operators - Used to Compare values
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators - Used for combining conditions
and, or, not

Assignment Operators - To assign values to variables
=, +=, -=, /=, *=, //=, %=, **=

Bitwise Operators - Useful in low-level programming, Operates on bits (1s and 0s)

Membership Operators - Check if element exists in a collection (list, tuple…)
in, not in

Identity Operators - Compare memory locations of two objects
is, is not

Interview question
	- is vs ==
